    <div class="About">
        <p>Hello! My name is Arbab and I am currently a student at The City College of New York studying computer science.
            I am passionate about front end development and would love to pursue a career in it. When I am not programming on my desk, you
        can find me playing soccer or working out at the jungle gym in my local park.</p>
